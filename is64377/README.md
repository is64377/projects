0. Replace earthquakes with OSHA data (from your CSV) -- start from the Class #5 demo
    * This has been done in Instructional demo #2 (see link above)

2. Create a *gist* with your result and add that link to your project repo's README.md
3. Create a new gist that implements the next feature
4. Repeat until done.
