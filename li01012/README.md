## To Do

Next steps for the project....

#### Documentation

Add the following content to the README.md in your repo.

* You have a file called README -- rename it to README.md and update the content
* Provide a URL to the source of your new CSV file
* Provide an extremely brief description of all pre-processing, if any.

#### Technical

For each step, create a separate gist/block -- link to these in your repo's README.md

1. Since your projects are similar, start with your instructional demo (above) and get it to zoom in on Texas instead of New York...
